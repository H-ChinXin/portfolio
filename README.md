# Cx's portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repo, which reveals how the website was built! The goal of creating this portfolio website is to give you an in-depth look at my professional journey, highlighting my work experience, skills, and education. It transforms my PDF resume into a convenient web version that you can easily view without needing to download anything.
<br/><br/>
Designed for clarity and engagement, it highlights my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates my ability to create responsive and interactive web applications. It also contains a form that uses third-party libraries, including Quill Editor for seamless email templates and EmailJS to send messages to the configured email address.

Whether you're here to learn more about my background, explore my skills, or get in touch, I hope you find this site both informative and visually appealing.
